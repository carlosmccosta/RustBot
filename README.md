# RustBot
Software tools for the project Sistemas Embarcados de Vistoria (SEV). We refer to the hardware platform as RustBot because the AVT Mako cameras look kind of rusty (sorry for the lack of creativity).

First, the Vimba sdk must be installed and compiled. We will refer to the folder where the sdk is installed as **$(Vimba_2_0)**

You may download this sdk from [https://www.alliedvision.com/en/products/software.html](https://www.alliedvision.com/en/products/software.html). Then follow the installation instructions in **$(Vimba_2_0)/Documentation/ReleaseNotes.txt** to install the sdk.

After that, the ros vimba wrapper at [http://wiki.ros.org/avt_vimba_camera](http://wiki.ros.org/avt_vimba_camera) should work. Follow these steps.

Install the ros wrapper

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srv/avt_vimba_camera.git
catkin_make
```

Find out the ip address and the id of your cameras. From the **$(VimbaPath)/examples/ListCamera** folder, run

```bash
cd $(Vimba_2_0)
/Tools/Viewer/Bin/x86_64bit/VimbaViewer
```

You shoud see the VimbaViewer gui with all connected cameras with their id (guid). 

![vimba_viewer](https://github.com/miguelriemoliveira/RustBot/blob/master/docs/vimba_viewer.png)

Select a camera and then, on the right side pane, select All propperties and search for "IP Address" to find out the the ip address.

![get_ipaddress](https://github.com/miguelriemoliveira/RustBot/blob/master/docs/get_ipaddress.png)



You may edit the file **launch/mono_camera.launch** and 
 

By setting the correct guid and ip of your camera.

You can get the guid and ip of your camera by using the ListCamera or VimbaViewer binaries in

Vimba_2_0/VimbaCPP/Examples/Bin/x86_64bit
